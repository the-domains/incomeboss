Read Google's exam study guides</h3><p>Google provides<a href="https://support.google.com/partners/topic/3204437?hl=en&ref_topic=3111012">AdWords exam study guides</a>and<a href="https://support.google.com/partners/topic/6083717">Analytics study guide</a>on the Google Partners platform. These are useful to read and write notes on to help you revise. There are PDF versions of the study guides available for every certification apart from the shopping advertising exam, which you can easily print off. If you are a visual learner, Google also provides videos to help you learn.</p><p>You should also work through the Google Analytics Academy to help improve your skills using the courses of Digital Analytics Fundamentals, Google Analytics Platform Principles, E-commerce Analytics: From Data to Decisions, Mobile App Analytics Fundamentals and Google Tag Manager Fundamentals available.</p><h3>2. Use the Analytics or AdWords platforms</h3><p>The obvious way to learn about the AdWords and Analytics platforms is to actually use them. For the AdWords exam, you should create, manage and improve a few AdWords campaigns. You should also learn about how to use Google Analytics, how it integrates with other products as well as how it works.</p><h3>3. Practice exam-style questions</h3><p>You should practice answering exam style questions. Some PPC resources recommend simply taking the AdWords exam to practice the questions and find out what to learn. iPass offers a few free AdWords exam style questions, but the rest of it needs to be paid for. There are other AdWords practice tests available from Way to Exam and GyaniAkash. You can also practice questions on the Google Analytics test website.</p><h3>4. Take the exam in a quiet place</h3><p>You should ensure you take the exam in a quiet place so you can concentrate.</p><h3>5. Read the questions more than once</h3><p>It is a teacher tip, but you should always read every question more than once to ensure you understand what the question is asking. This will help you answer the question correctly.</p><h3>6. Look out for trick questions</h3><p>The exams have a few trick questions. There may be many good answers to the questions, but you should answer with the<em>best</em>answer available.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5b8e32eb13a9830aa29be160683a0907338ccaff.gif" alt="" title=""></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">incomeback</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
