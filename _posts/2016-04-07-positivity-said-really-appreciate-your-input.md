Positivity said: ↑  
Really appreciate your input.  
+++++++++++++++++  
I hate to say this, but you'll never get out of your day job with this mentality. You just won't. 5 years will pass, then 10, then 20, then 40, then next thing you know you'll be having your first grandkid and think back... and you'll recall this conversation. Then and only then will you know deep down inside whether you chose the right path in your life.

This life isn't for everyone, especially those that think there is big rewards WHILE being risk-averse, rewards and risk-averse are a contradiction.

"Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think you are facing a contradiction, check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong." - Ayn Rand

Risk-Averse means low rewards. You'll be playing the safe zone your whole life. AND the biggest mistake you are making right now IS thinking that the CURRENT opportunities, whether it's SEO or cheap traffic will still exist in 5 or 10 years from now and you'll just be able to jump in. Look at the landscape 5 years ago, SEO was an easy walk in the park, then Panda and Penguin hit and only the strong survived. Do you think it's going to get easier?

Right now there is a gold-rush like in the wild west days on the internet. BUT it CANNOT last forever. The gold will be mined by those who took the risk. You think in the wild west days when people were traveling west to find gold they said "wait, I'll first go get a job, save up a $200-$300K then head out west..." NO. They picked up their shit and went, with no money. Imagine going into the wilderness with no stores, or source of food except whatever you can kill, with no roads, and city infrastructure, no building and just with a tent looking for gold. That's some serious fucking risk, but there was gold to be mined.

What happens when you get your $300K job, you'll have a lifestyle that's worth $300K with bills, house payments, and all sort of shit which will chain you down, do you honestly believe if you start dating some one they are going to be fine with taking a cut in lifestyle or even YOU are going to be fine with taking a cut in lifestyle to living off of zero dollars for 1-3 years before your projects get off the ground as you see your savings dwindling?

Your fallacy is you believe there will be gold here forever AND that the current techniques of mining the gold will last until you get back in the game. There are going to be new techniques, new players, new competitors who are younger, stronger, and take more risk in a single day than you have in your life up till that moment you get back in the game. Do you believe you can win? I know if I was lulled to sleep into a comfortable living for 5 or 10 years there is no way I'll ever be able to get the entrepreneurial spirit back.

That hustling spirit needs to be fed, and if you can't figure out or come to the conclusion in your mind RIGHT NOW that you can make it, you won't. You aren't a hustler or entrepreneur, not really, and you know it, you know it deep down, cause real entrepreneurs don't think about the risk over the rewards, they always think about the rewards, disregard the risk, AND know they have the drive to keep fighting even during the darkest moments. You can't turn on the hustler spirit once it's off, either you are in the mode or not, and once it's off, it will NEVER come back. It just won't because you were defeated by your fear.

You should probably honestly stick to your day job path and erase the idea of making riches with the internet monies from your mind, cause you are risk-averse. -CCarter
